    /*
     The player character is created automatically with 1000 health, 50 attack power and death count = 0 (these numbers might change based on future balance Swing.boxLayout).
     Health is how much life the character has. We need two variables to handle it: maximumHealth, and currentHealth.
     Attack power determines how much damage the player character can cause to the enemies. (will probably use a random modifier in the final version)
     If death count reaches "3" the game is over

Game Introduction is displayed
    // Mini Story talking about the game environment and also displays the objective of the game.
        /*
         The objective of the game is to reach the top of the mountain and defeat the dragon
         There are 21 locations in the game (an array of size 21). The player starts at index [0], which is a town and the dragon will be at index [20].
         The other array indexes (game locations) will be divided between battle encounters(B), healing shrines(H), and treasure areas(T).
         The layout of the array locations will be the following:
         [0=Town], [1=B], [2=B], [3=H], [4=T], [5B][6B][7H][8T][9B][10B][11H][12T][13B][14B][15H][16T][17B][18B][19H], [20=Dragon].
         The player needs to roll a 3-sided die to determine how to move the player character through the array (If the player starts at index[0] and rolls a "2" he will move to
         index[2], which is a battle encounter, and so forth).
        */

Player rolls dice to determine how many steps to move [1-3] // this is a button, that selects a random number between 1-3

Player moves to array index based on dice result.
